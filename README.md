my personal PoE2 filter (modified from the NeverSink's V0.1.1 filter)


To use this, download the .filter file. Put it in your PoE2 filter location. By default, it should be located in this path: C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2
Put the file anywhere in the said path, click the refresh button in PoE2 game and you should see the filter listed there. Enjoy.
