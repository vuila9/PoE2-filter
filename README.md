my personal PoE2 filter (modified from the NeverSink's V0.1.1 filter)

To use this, download the *.filter* file. Put it in your PoE2 filter location. By default, it should be located in this path: *C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2*

Put the file anywhere in the said path, click the refresh button in PoE2 game and you should see the filter listed there. Enjoy.

There’s another file in this repo named ***ReShadePreset.ini***. It’s a preset for the third-party software ReShade, which I use to enhance the in-game visual effects. From my experience, using this hasn’t resulted in any bans, at least not in the 100 hours of playtime I’ve logged so far.
To even consider using this particular file, I’m assuming you already know how to install ReShade for your game. Therefore, I won’t provide any installation guide. Just a quick note: this preset was created using ReShade version 6.1.1. I've never encountered any bugs from using the preset with a different version of ReShade. However, should there be any problem or bug, it's probalby due to version incompatibility.

If you think PoE2 has good visual effects, using this ReShade preset on top would make the game looks 10 times better. Of course, you might have to adjust some of the ingame graphic setting such as lowering the brightness, reducing sharpness.
