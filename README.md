my personal PoE2 filter (modified from the NeverSink's V0.1.1 filter)

To use this, download the .filter file. Put it in your PoE2 filter location. By default, it should be located in this path: C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2

Put the file anywhere in the said path, click the refresh button in PoE2 game and you should see the filter listed there. Enjoy.

There’s another file in this repo named ReShadePreset.ini. It’s a preset for the third-party software ReShade, which I use to enhance the in-game visual effects. From my experience, using this hasn’t resulted in any bans, at least not in the 100 hours of playtime I’ve logged so far.
To even consider using this particular file, I’m assuming you already know how to install ReShade for your game. Therefore, I won’t provide any installation guide. Just a quick note: this preset was created using ReShade version 6.1.1.
